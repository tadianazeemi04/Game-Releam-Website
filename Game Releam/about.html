                <h2>Why Should You Play Video Games at Games Releam?</h2>
                <p>Although doctors caution against excessive screen time, plenty of positive findings prove the benefits of gaming. With direct changes recorded in brain activity, gaming can even help treat mental conditions like ADHD!</p>
        
                <h3>Increase Your Brain Matter</h3>
                <p>Games impact your brain’s ability to change when learning, causing plasticity through rewards and attention control. Since games make you more capable of directing attention toward a specific task, such as maneuvering obstacles to finish a race, they stimulate the brain once you complete the task. The plasticity increases since you’ll proceed to other, more challenging levels as the game progresses.</p>
                <p>Video games provide adrenaline, which improves the brain’s gray matter, which consists of billions of neurons that regulate emotions, retain memories, and control movement. The more you play, the more your brain adapts!</p>
        
                <h3>Enjoy a Stimulating Activity</h3>
                <p>Unlike gluing your eyes to the TV, gaming is an interactive activity requiring attention and management skills. For example, in a role-playing game (RPG), you must complete many quest objectives in a particular order, but there might be even a longer list of side quests in the story. You’ll feel a sense of accomplishment when receiving trophies or advancing your character’s skills. The constant barrage of reinforcement in gaming exceeds what you might experience in real life.</p>
        
                <h3>Improve Your Focus and Motor Skills</h3>
                <p>Video games are detail-oriented and require constant interaction to accomplish tasks at each level. As such, gamers get to enhance focus because they must pay close attention to the changing visual and audio cues. Besides, you can also develop hand-eye coordination when playing games that require quickly differentiating or matching certain items.</p>
                <p>If you love playing driving games, you can also develop fine motor skills when traversing challenging terrain requiring navigating curvy race tracks at high speeds.</p>
        
                <h3>Enhance Your Cognitive Functions</h3>
                <p>Multitasking is the ability to handle different tasks simultaneously—a skill you can acquire or polish through gaming. Furthermore, gaming improves the ability to start a task immediately after completing another (also known as set-shifting), which is essential in today’s fast-paced world. You’ll enjoy enhanced cognitive functions once you learn to direct attention from one thing to the next and perform various tasks simultaneously.</p>
                <p>For example, you can improve attention by playing action games and increase performance in recognition, perception, and navigation by playing puzzle games.</p>
